# Spring 2020 Computer and Network Administration — Assignment 3

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**  
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**  

## ❖・Introduction・❖
The answers to all the following questions should be included between the fenced backticks following each question. You may need to log in to the Linux systems on campus to test your answers. Recall that you can remotely connect to the Linux boxes using a variant of the command `ssh USER@user-COMPUTER.cs.hartford.edu`, where `USER` is the user you created at the beginning of the semester, and `COMPUTER` is one of `autechre`, `bauhaus`, `cappadonna`, `deftones`, `eluvium`, or `fugees`. For instance, if I wanted to log in to the `bauhaus` machine, I’d do so as follows:

```bash
ssh roy@user-bauhaus.cs.hartford.edu
```

## ❖・Questions・❖

### Question 1
Write a script that recursively copies all the files in one folder to another folder. The names of both folders should be arguments to the script. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 2
Write a script that checks whether a program exists on your machine. This program will be passed to your script via an argument. If the program doesn’t exist, it should try to fetch the program via `apt install`. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 3
Write a command that will create an empty file with a `.txt` extension named after the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 4
Write a command that will recursively remove files with the `.thumbs` extension from the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 5
Write a command that will recursively remove empty folders from the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 6
Write a script that reports every file name in a folder as two items: the filename and its extension. Each item should appear on a new line. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 7
Write a script that requests the user answer `y` or `n` to a prompt, and only exits when either of the two responses is entered. The user’s response should be echoed to the screen _before_ the program exits. (_`28` pts_)

```bash
```
